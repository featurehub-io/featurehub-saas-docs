=== What happens if FH server goes down?

It is possible in rare events that in can go down. As feature values get cached by Fastly, a customer will keep getting latest served value. For example, if you are using a server app, your users wouldnâ€™t experience a problem. However, if you are serving features via bowser app, users would lose the feature value when browser app reinitialises, e.g. on page refresh.
